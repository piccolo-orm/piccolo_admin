Changes
=======

0.11.10
------
 * The foreign key selector in the add and edit row forms now use the search
 based UI - courtesy of sinisaos.
 * Fixing a Vue JS warning about a route parameter being undefined.

0.11.9
------
 * Exposed the ``host`` and ``port`` options directly in the sandbox CLI.
 * Fixing a bug with read only mode - was raising a 500 with disallowed HTTPS
 methods

0.11.8
------
 * The foreign key selector in the sidebar is now search based, rather than a
select element - courtesy of sinisaos. This makes the admin work better with
very large data sets.
 * Fixed a bug with nullable foreign keys. The value can now be set to null
without a validation error.

0.11.7
------
Added a ``--inflate`` option to the CLI in example.py. This allows lots of
dummy data to be added during development.

0.11.6
------
Fixing a bug with the date time picker on mobile devices - thanks sinisaos!

0.11.5
------
Fixing a bug where clearing the filters wasn't clearing the duration widget's
value, as it uses a hidden input - thanks sinisaos!

0.11.4
------
Added missing trailing slash to table detail endpoints.

0.11.3
------
Fixing auth API URL - thanks sinisaos!

0.11.2
------
requirements.txt fixes

0.11.1
------
Updated Node dependencies, and fixed requirements clash with FastAPI and
Starlette.

0.11.0
------
 * Refactored ``AdminRouter`` to use ``FastAPI``. This means the API is fully
documented - courtesy of sinisaos.
 * Moved auth endpoints from ``/api/`` to ``/auth/``, to separate
auth from the main API.

0.10.9
------
Fixing a bug with fetching meta information from the API (Piccolo version,
site name etc). When a user isn't logged in, it would fail. It now calls the
API again after a successful login - courtesy of sinisaos.

0.10.8
------
 * Can override the nav bar title (defaults to `Piccolo Admin`) - courtesy of
   sinisaos.
 * Other nav bar improvements, such as truncating long usernames.

 * Minor fixes

sinisaos.

0.10.5
------
Added a CSV export button to the row listing - courtesy of sinisaos.

0.10.4
------
 * Removed dependency number for ``uvicorn`` and ``Hypercorn`` - only the very
   high level API is being used, which is unlikely to change, and was causing
   issues for some users when installing via Poetry.
 * Bumped node dependencies.

Fixing packaging issues - add Python 3.8 classifier, and missing index.html
file.
