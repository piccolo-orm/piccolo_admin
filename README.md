# Piccolo Admin

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/piccolo-admin/badge/?version=latest)](https://piccolo-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Piccolo Admin is a powerful admin interface / content management system for Python, built on top of Piccolo.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo_admin/master/docs/images/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

It was created at a design agency to serve the needs of customers who demand a high quality, beautiful admin interface for their websites. It's a modern alternative to tools like Wordpress and Django Admin.

It's built using the latest technologies, with Vue.js on the front end, and a powerful REST backend.

Some of it's standout features:

* Powerful data filtering
* Builtin security
* Media support, both locally and in S3 compatible services
* Dark mode support
* CSV exports
* Easily create custom forms
* Works on mobile and desktop
* Use standalone, or integrate it easily with ASGI apps like FastAPI, and Starlette
* Multilingual out of box
* Bulk actions, like updating and deleting data
* Flexible UI - only show the columns you want your users to see

## Try it

[Try it online](https://demo1.piccolo-orm.com/) (username: piccolo, password: piccolo123).

## Local Demo

To run a demo locally, using Python 3.8 or above:

```bash
pip install piccolo_admin
admin_demo
```

And then just launch `localhost:8000` in your browser.

To see what happens behind the scenes, see `piccolo_admin/example.py`.

In a few lines of code we are able to:

-   Define our models
-   Setup a database
-   Create a REST API
-   Setup a web server and admin interface

## ASGI

Since the admin is an ASGI app, you can either run it standalone like in the demo, or integrate it with a larger ASGI app such as FastAPI and Starlette.

For example, using Starlette routes:

```python
from piccolo_admin.endpoints import create_admin
from starlette.routing import Router, Route
import uvicorn

from my_project.tables import Director, Movie


# The `allowed_hosts` argument is required when running under HTTPS. It's used
# for additional CSRF defence.
admin = create_admin([Director, Movie], allowed_hosts=['my_site.com'])


router = Router([
    Route(path="/", endpoint=Hello),
    Mount(path="/admin/", app=admin),
])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run(router)

```
