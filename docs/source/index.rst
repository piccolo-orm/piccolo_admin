Piccolo Admin
=============

`Piccolo Admin <https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo_admin>`_ provides a
simple yet powerful admin interface on top of Piccolo tables - allowing you to
easily add / edit / filter your data.

It was created at a design agency to serve the needs of customers who demand a
high quality, beautiful admin interface for their websites. Our goal is to
create a world class admin interface, akin to Wordpress or Django.

It's built using the latest technologies, with Vue JS on the front end, and a
modern REST backend.
